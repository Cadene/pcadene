#### Main graduate courses and seminars given in recent years

*This list presents the different graduate courses and seminars given over the last ten years at the Université Paris Cité, my home institution, but also for some at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences where I was adjunct professor for few years in the 2010 decade*

#### Master Seminar: ‘Theory and Practice of Development: Globalisation and New Research Issues in Development Studies’

The objectives of the course are to present the theoretical fields, concepts and currents of analysis in the field of development and studies on emerging and developing countries. The aim is to offer students a history of ideas through a critical analysis of various authors, as well as an introduction to post-development studies. In addition to a history and epistemology of development studies based on readings of theoretical and empirical texts, a critical reflection on the central concepts of developmentalist studies, on the questions of the North-South disjunction, on the diversity of what is generically called "the Souths", on past or current development models and on the territorial dimensions, at different scales, of the insertion of emerging and developing countries into globalisation is presented. 

#### Master Seminar: ‘Globalisation, Urban and Regional Development in South Asia’ 

This seminar aims to raise students' awareness of new research issues in South Asia. It focuses on development processes and regional integration dynamics in the context of globalisation. Particular interest is placed on the role of metropolises in South Asia, on the processes of metropolisation and on the dynamics of regional organisation.

#### Master Seminar: ‘Regional Planning and Development Strategy in the Global South’

The objective of the seminar is to study the modalities of implementation of regional planning operations today. The first step is to understand and analyse the processes of regional development and to get to know the actors involved. The term "region" refers here to sub-national territories organised by coherent economic and social processes, which do not necessarily coincide with administrative divisions, or to supra-state spaces such as the major international corridors and cross-border economic integration zones. These two regional scales will not be treated separately but jointly in order to highlight not only the specificities of development of each but also and above all their complementarity and their interactions. The main point of the seminar is to show how regional planning and development operations have progressively evolved towards the elaboration and application of development strategies in a context where the advancement of the phenomenon of globalisation creates uncertainty and forces permanent adjustments of the policies implemented. The last part of the seminar aims to introduce students to the construction of these regional development strategies.

#### Master workshops: ‘Urban planning and regional development strategies in emerging or developing countrys’

These workshops aim to place students in a concrete situation of carrying out an urban or regional development project in an emerging or developing country. Students participate in one of the proposed workshops, in groups (4 to 6 students per group). They are jointly supervised by a teacher-researcher and a teacher-professional of the Master. They are required to respond to a commission from a development institution (consultancy firm, administrations, etc.).
