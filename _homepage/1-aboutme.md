I am Emeritus Professor in the field of Geography and Development Studies at Université Paris Cité, France, where I have been Head of the GHES School (Geography, History, Economy and Societies) from October 2019 to September 2022, and was previously Chair of Geography Department (2013-2017).

I'm currently conducting research and supervise PhD theses at the [CESSMA](http://cessma.univ-paris-diderot.fr/spip.php?article989), the Centre for Social Sciences studies on the African, American and Asian worlds (Centre d’Études en Sciences sociales sur les Mondes Africains, Américains et Asiatiques).

I am part of various research projects in the frame of an international interdisciplinary network named 'Reshaping Business in an Uncertain World' (Rebus project), which I played a key role in establishing. The primary goal of this research network is to analyze how economic systems adapt to the changes brought about by globalization, and by the crises it is causing, with a focus on studying the reorganization processes within 'Global Production Networks.'

Within this framework, my research focuses on diverse themes across three different countries:
In India, I'm examining the impact of economic liberalization on the reorganization of the marble and granite industry in Rajasthan, as well as the globalization of the textile industry in southern Rajasthan. Additionally, I'm exploring the development of cultural industries.
In Tunisia, my research delves into the economic networks involved in olive oil production in the Sfax region.
In Greece, I'm studying the development of high-tech companies in Attica.

In addition to these projects, I am also engaged in personal research focusing on regional development and territorial inequalities in India, all the while writing on various theoretical and methodological aspects of geography.
