I began my advanced studies at the University of Toulouse, where I have summited my PhD (D.Lit.) in 1985 under Prof. Bernard Kayser. My thesis dissertation focused on the evolution of suburban areas in France. During these early years of research, I also started my first field works in India, where I was affiliated at the Centre for Study of Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi.

Then, I was Junior Research Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, Sussex University, England, following with a post-doctoral work at the South Asian Institute, Heidelberg University, Germany. I joined the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) in 1989, and was affiliated at the Centre for India and South Asia Studies (CEIAS), EHESS, Paris. I continued research programs on urban and regional development, mainly in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. I also worked at all India level with Prof. François Durand-Dastes for the South Asia volume of the Universal Geography, edited by Prof. Roger Brunet in 1993.

In 1995, I was appointed as Professor of Urban Geography at the University Paul Valery, Montpellier. There, I conducted research at the Maison de la Géographie de Montpellier and took part at the creation of the UMR ESPACE. In 2000, I joined the Department of Geography at the University Paris Diderot, on a chair of Development studies. I was affiliated with the SEDET, recently renamed CESSMA. I extended my interest to the emerging countries of Asia and to the Gulf countries, then started a long term collaboration with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai.

From 2010 to 2011, I was seconded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for developing university and scientific cooperation at the French Embassy in India. In November 2011, I was appointed for two years as Professor in the Department of Geography and Planning at the Paris Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi.

In September 2013, I resumed my duties at the Paris Diderot University and share my time between academic and administrative activity. During this years, Paris Diderot University has entered in a merger process with Paris Descartes University to create the [University Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/en/) in January 2020.
